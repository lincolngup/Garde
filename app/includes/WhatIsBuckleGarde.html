        <p>
            BuckleGarde is a security cover that surrounds the safety buckles
            used in medical and paramedical transport, deterring the patient
            from actuating the push button and releasing the buckle. Some
            patients, because of confusion, intoxication or suicidal ideations, do
            not want to remain on their gurneys, wheelchairs, beds, or other
            medical apparatuses. Patients have removed their safety straps by
            actuating the push button, causing injury to themselves and medical
            personnel.
        </p>
        <p>
            The BuckleGarde provides an added deterrent to the safety buckles
            currently being used in the industry that is short of more aggressive
            two-point or four-point patient restraints. Safety buckles secured
            with a BuckleGarde cannot easily be released by the patient. If the
            patient attempts to release the safety buckle, the BuckleGarde
            introduces enough of a delay for other interventions to be
            undertaken.

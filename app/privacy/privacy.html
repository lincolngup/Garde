                the site and to improve its performance and usefulness. We also
                collect information you volunteer, such as comments, survey
                responses, purchasing and billing information, and your requests.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you place an order, we need to know your name, e-mail
                address, mailing address, and billing information, which may include
                your credit card number and expiration date. This allows us to
                process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status.

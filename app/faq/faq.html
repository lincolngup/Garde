                                In 2007, a patient died after unbuckling from a gurney,
                                opening the door of a moving ambulance, and departing
                                from the back of the vehicle. Fellow University of
                                Denver MBA students Wayne Guerra, an EMS physician,
                                and Lincoln Gup, a former EMT, had both seen patients
                                and paramedic personnel injured after patients suddenly
                                and surprisingly unbuckled themselves from their safety
                                straps. The potentially preventable ambulance tragedy,
                                coupled with their collective experiences, motivated them
                                to find a way to make patient transports safer. To achieve
                                this goal, Wayne and Lincoln started Garde Systems LLC.

                                Four-point restraints and similar systems can prevent
                                patients from exiting an ambulance by themselves, but
                                these kinds of restraints can cause psychological damage
                                and even physical harm as patients struggle against them.
                                Rather than going this direction, Wayne and Lincoln felt
                                they needed to create a way to make it very difficult for
                                patients to unbuckle the gurney safety belt. They developed
                                the BuckleGarde as a safety buckle cover that can be quickly
                                manipulated by healthcare personnel, but is very difficult
                                for patients to unbuckle themselves. This created a new level
                                of restraint that was more secure than verbal instructions
                                but short of physically restraining the arms or legs.

                                While the concept is simple, it took over 30 computer-aided
                                design (CAD) drawings and seven prototypes for us to arrive
                                at our finished product. Each version was shown to practicing
                                paramedics and their recommendations were put into subsequent
                                modifications until we arrived at a product that was both
                                versatile and functional.

                                We chose an advanced plastic technology with the physical

                                The BuckleGarde is designed to accommodate both a safety
                                buckle and shoulder straps. We’ve tested the BuckleGarde
                                with hundreds of combinations of safety buckles and straps.

                In July 2007, a suburban Denver ambulance began a routine “psych transfer” of a 36-year-old
                woman from a hospital to a psychiatric facility. During transport, the woman leapt from the
                moving ambulance onto a busy interstate. She later died of her injuries.
            </p>
            <p>
                Similar incidents are by no means uncommon. In September 2007, another psych transfer ended
                in  tragedy  after  a  suicidal  patient  jumped  from  a  moving  ambulance  in  Lansing,
                Mich.,  and  was hit  and  killed  by  a  car.  Three  other  deaths  from  patients  jumping
                from  ambulances (one in 2002 and two more in 2005) in Michigan were reviewed recently in a
                medical journal as a warning to providers  about  the  possibility  of  suicidal  patients
                killing  themselves  during  transport.

                In 2007 a patient died after unbuckling from a gurney, opening the door of
                the ambulance and departing from the back of the moving vehicle. It was a
                potentially preventable tragedy that I couldn’t stop thinking about.

                Garde Systems today announced the availability of the BuckleGarde, a new,
                easy-to-use tool for EMS personnel to help deter patients from removing
                their safety straps, creating a safer transport environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                BuckleGarde is a security cover that surrounds the safety buckles used in
                medical and paramedical transport, deterring the patient from pushing the
                button and releasing the buckle. Patients have removed their safety straps
                while ambulances are in motion, causing injury to themselves and medical
                personnel. The BuckleGarde bridges the gap between verbal restraint
                and more aggressive restraint methods.

                The widower and children of a woman who jumped to her death from a
                moving ambulance on Interstate 25 has filed a lawsuit accusing the
                ambulance company of negligence. Mellissa Watkins, 36, of Aurora,
                died July 8. A crew from Action Care Ambulance Inc. was transporting
                Watkins from a hospital in Parker to a hospital in Louisville when she
                jumped, Greenwood Village police have said.

                Authorities still do not know why a 36-year-old nurse jumped to her death
                from a moving ambulance on Interstate 25. Melissa Lynn Watkins, of Aurora,
                was being transported as a patient from Parker Adventist Hospital to another
                hospital when she jumped out of the back of the ambulance, slammed on to the
                pavement and rolled to the side of the highway.

                A builder who suffered 86% burns in a workshop accident "rolled" out of
                an airborne air ambulance taking him to hospital, an inquest has heard.
                Joel Perry was engulfed in flames when petrol vapour ignited as he tried
                to start an engine in his Burtle workshop. The 41-year-old was being
                flown to hospital in Weston-super-Mare after the accident when he tried
                to get out.

                A badly-burned man has died after he panicked and jumped out of an air
                ambulance taking him to hospital last week, police have revealed. The
                helicopter was about six feet off the ground as it made an emergency

                medics.

                A man died in hospital after he was struck by a car as he jumped from the
                back of an ambulance on to a busy dual carriageway. The patient, who is

                Hospital when he tried to leave the ambulance, and paramedics were forced
